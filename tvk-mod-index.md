# Model of Development w/ AI coding

This document introduces 3 **operational models** for software development using AI coding tools. It establishes roles, responsibilities, handoff protocols, and workflow patterns for human and AI contributors.

This is not a theoretical framework. It is a working model born from practical constraints and refined through real architectural work.
