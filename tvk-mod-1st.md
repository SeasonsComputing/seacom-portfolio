# Model of Development w/ AI coding

This document introduces 3 **operational models** for software development using AI coding tools. It establishes roles, responsibilities, handoff protocols, and workflow patterns for human and AI contributors.

While this project did not begin as a theoretical framework. **"3rb"** is a working model born from practical constraints and refined through real architectural work.

However recently I have imagined an evolution commensurate with the rapid advances in AI & AI coding.

## 1. Three-role Model

Model of development: [**"3rm"**](markdown.html?tvk-mod-3rm.md)

### 1.1. Use Case

What would the scope of my most recent project, swarmAg Operations System, be if
constructed with a traditional software team?

- Optimistic scope is me + 3 engineers, ~6+ months

- Actual results was me + AIx2, ~4 months

- **~4.5X productivity**

## 2. Four-Role Model: Critic Role

Model of development: [**"4rm"**](markdown.html?tvk-mod-4rm.md)

Using the above method the **4rm** was imagined.

## 3. Swarm Orchestration Model

Model of development: [**"som"**](markdown.html?tvk-mod-som.md)

The **som** was the logical extension in scaling.
