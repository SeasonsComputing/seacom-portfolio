# Professional Experience

Source: [Ted V. Kremer - Résumé - 2026](tvk-resume-2026.md)

I began my professional journey in 1981, writing accounting software on the
TRS-80 for my father's software startup. That early experience revealed a
passion for entrepreneurship and technology that still drives me.

Over four decades as a serial entrepreneur of venture-backed and bootstrapped startups,
I've led technology for half-a-dozen companies, authored novel innovations
awarded patent protection and navigated successful liquidity events.
As a technical founder I've executed and evolved a principal founder's vision
as if it were my own. I'm hands-on across the SDLC — from R&D, architecture
and code to customer acceptance and feedback.

I'm an early adopter of most software paradigm shifts of the last 30 years —
from object-oriented/dynamic/functional programming and OSS to cloud computing/SaaS/IaaS,
distributed processing, machine learning and NLP. Throughout, I've
remained committed to the first principles of agile guarantees, disciplined engineering
and best practices.

Today, I employ AI across the entire SDLC and full development stack:
imagining, planning and architecture through development, deployment and evolution.

### 4.12 ProtoSoft (1990-1992)

_Software Engineer_

ProtoSoft produced a cross-platform meta-modeling software design tool,
ParadigmPlus, supporting a variety of notations and methods for the aerospace
industry in Clear Lake City, Texas.

#### Innovation

Sophisticated meta-model, schemas & instances, with scripting  
such that proprietary methodology could be implemented (diagram types,
regulatory content, auto-enforced rules & constraints).
The full specification of a methodology was a "Paradigm".

### 5.2 Career Philosophy

Dedicated to building the best possible products, teams, and companies. Always curious.
Guided by essential first principles.

- **Agile gaurantees, disciplined engineering and best practices** - only the
  "with what" and the "why" change, "how" remains constant
- **Less is almost always more** - less design, fewer features, less code results in
  more quality, more reliability. It is the single greatest tool for minimizing complexity
- **Pareto principle of feature design** - craft the 20% of functionality that
  satisfies 80% of customer needs
- **Better to kill a feature than ship incomplete** - half-baked features that
  aren't used and reflect poorly on the whole product are costly and worse,
  may result in reputational damage and distrust
- **Do it right, do it now** - it's never faster nor cheaper to do it right
  later. In fact, it's worse because often time misjudgment becomes institutionalized
  in shared memories and imbued in the software produced
- **Anyone can write code that works** - writing functional software is the bare minimum.
  Constructing software that is essential, durable, minimalist, comprehensible _and_
  functional _while_ adhering to first principles is aspirational
- **Leaders set the standard, even when they don't** - implicit behavior sets the
  standard for the entire team as much as explicit expectations
