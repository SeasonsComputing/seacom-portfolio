# Professional Experience

Source: [Ted V. Kremer - Résumé - 2026](tvk-resume-2026.md)

I began my professional journey in 1981, writing accounting software on the
TRS-80 for my father's software startup. That early experience revealed a
passion for entrepreneurship and technology that still drives me.

Over four decades as a serial entrepreneur of venture-backed and bootstrapped startups,
I've led technology for half-a-dozen companies, authored novel innovations
awarded patent protection and navigated successful liquidity events.
As a technical founder I've executed and evolved a principal founder's vision
as if it were my own. I'm hands-on across the SDLC — from R&D, architecture
and code to customer acceptance and feedback.

I'm an early adopter of most software paradigm shifts of the last 30 years —
from object-oriented, dynamic and functional programming to cloud computing,
distributed processing, machine learning and artificial intelligence. Throughout, I've
remained committed to the first principles of agile guarantees, disciplined engineering
and best practices.

Today, I employ AI across the SDLC and full development stack:
imagining, planning and architecture through development, deployment and maintenance.

### 4.12 ProtoSoft (1990-1992)

_Software Engineer_

ProtoSoft produced a cross-platform meta-modeling software design tool,
ParadigmPlus, supporting a variety of notations and methods for the aerospace
industry in Clear Lake City, Texas.

#### Technical Highlights

Sophisticated meta-model, schemas & instances, with scripting  
such that proprietary methods could be implemented (diagram types,
regulatory content, auto-enforced methodology rules & constraints).
The full specification of a methodology was a "Paradigm".

### 5.2 Career Philosophy

Dedicated to building the best possible products, teams, and companies. Always curious.
Guided by essential first principles.

- **Agile gaurantees, disciplined engineering and best practices** - only the
  "with what" and the "why" change, "how" remains constant
- **Less is almost always more** - less design, fewer features, less code results in fewer
  defects. It is the single greatest simplification tool for reducing complexity
- **Pareto principle of feature design** - craft the 20% of functionality that
  satisfies 80% of customer needs
- **Better to kill a feature than ship incomplete** - half-baked features that
  aren't used and reflect poorly on the whole product are costly and worse,
  may result in reputational damage and distrust
- **Do it right, do it now** - it's never faster nor cheaper to do it right
  later. In fact, it's worse because often time misjudgment becomes institutionalized
  in shared memories and imbued in the software artifacts produced
- **Anyone can write code that works** - writing functional software is the bare minimum.
  Constructing software that is essential, durable, minimalist, comprehensible _and_
  functional _while_ adhering to first principles is aspirational
- **Leaders set the standard, even when they don't** - implicit behavior sets the
  standard for the entire team as much as explicit expectations
