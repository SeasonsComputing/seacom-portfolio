# Ted V. Kremer - Professional Experience

Source: [Ted V. Kremer - Résumé - 2026](tvk-resume-2026.md)

I began my professional journey in 1981, writing accounting software on the TRS-80 for my father's software startup. That early immersion revealed a passion for entrepreneurship and technology that drives me still.

Over four decades as a serial entrepreneur, I've founded and led half-a-dozen companies, authored novel innovations awarded patent protection, and navigated successful liquidity events. As an early adopter of industry paradigm shifts—from object-oriented/dynamic/functional programming, to SQL/OLAP/NoSQL/Text, to distributed processing & cloud computing, to machine learning & NLP, to CMM/UML/Agile—one principle has remained constant: engineering discipline as the foundation of the creative software process.

Between ventures, I return to Seasons Computing, my independent consultancy, where I provide strategic insight, technical leadership, software architecture, and full-stack development to organizations of all sizes.

*But really, I'm just an old-school coder who lives to craft software that is genuinely beautiful inside and out. I love this shit.*

## 2. Professional Summary

Technology executive, software architect, full-stack developer and SDLC manager spanning four decades. Serial entrepreneur with multiple exits, patent portfolio, and deep expertise across all aspects of software construction.

### 2.1 Career Philosophy

Dedicated to building excellent products, teams, and companies through innovation, leadership, and adoption of cutting-edge methodologies. Early adopter of paradigm shifts including object-oriented/dynamic/functional programming, unstructured data storage, cloud computing, distributed processing, and machine learning.
I am driven by a few first principles that have always served me well. For example:

- **Less is more**: less design, less features, less code, less UX. Will require less V&V and will contain fewer defects.
- **Do it right, Do it now**: it's never faster nor cheaper to do it right later. In fact it's worse because often time misjudgment becomes imbued and codified in the source.
